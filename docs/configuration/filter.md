Create one [filter] header per filter like **[filter MY FILTER NAME]**. All filter options are optional! If you don't use any filter options, then everything will be downloaded because your filter doesn't filter out anything.

**Note:** Not all filter options are supported on all trackers.


## General

#### enabled
> **Type:** Boolean
**Default:** true
**Example:** enabled = false
**Description:** Use it to disable a filter. All filters are enabled by default.

#### priority
> **Type:** Integer
**Default:** 0
**Example:** priority = 10
**Description:** Use it to determine the order by which filters are checked. Negative numbers are allowed.

#### match-sites
> **Type:** Comma separated list
**Example:** match-sites = tracker1, tracker2, tracker3
**Description:** It's compared against the tracker. Use the full tracker name, eg. MyTracker or use one of the tracker types found in ~/.irssi/scripts/AutodlIrssi/trackers/*.tracker. Open one of the files and locate the **type="XYZ"** line. Use the value inside the quotes, eg. **XYZ**.

#### except-sites
> **Description:** The exact opposite of **match-sites**. If a release matches this option, then it's NOT downloaded.

#### min-size
> **Type:** Size
**Example:** min-size = 200MB
**Default:** 0
**Description:** Used to filter out too small torrents.

#### max-size
> **Type:** Size
**Example:** max-size = 2.5GB
**Default:** any size is allowed
**Description:** Used to filter out too big torrents. Set it to a reasonable value, eg. for TV-shows, set it to about twice the size of a normal episode (just in case it's a double-episode).

#### upload-delay-secs
> **Type:** Integer
**Default:** 0 (no wait)
**Example:** upload-delay-secs = 10
**Description:** The number of seconds autodl-irssi should wait before uploading/saving the torrent.

#### max-downloads
> **Type:** Integer
**Example:** max-downloads = 15
**Description:** Download no more than this number of torrents per week/month (see **max-downloads-per**). Remove the filter option or set it to a negative number to disable it.

#### max-downloads-per
> **Type:** String
**Example:** max-downloads-per = week
**Description:** Valid values are **day**, **week**, and **month**. See **max-downloads**.

#### download-duplicates
> **Type:** Boolean
**Default:** false
**Example:** download-duplicates = true
**Description:** By default, it's false so no duplicate releases are downloaded. Set it to true if you want to download the same release if it's re-announced or announced by multiple trackers.


## P2P

#### match-releases
> **Type:** Comma separated list
**Example:** match-releases = The?Simpsons*, American?Dad*
**Description:** It's compared against the torrent name, eg. **Some.release.720p.HDTV-GROUP**. If the filter should only match TV-shows or movies, it's easier to use the **shows** filter option since it doesn't require wildcards.

#### except-releases
> **Description:** The exact opposite of **match-releases**. If a release matches this option, then it's NOT downloaded.

#### use-regex
> **Type:** Boolean
**Default:** false
**Description:** Changes match/except-releases filter options to use regex instead of wildcard syntax globally. This can also be set globally in the options header.

#### match-release-groups
> **Type:** Comma separated list
**Description:** Unless the release matches one of the release groups, it's not downloaded.

#### except-release-groups
> **Type:** Comma separated list
**Description:** Opposite of match-release-groups. If the release matches one of the release gorups, it's not downloaded.

#### max-pretime
> **Type:** time-since string
**Example:** max-pretime = 2 mins 3 secs
**Description:** Some sites announce the pretime of the release. Use this to filter out old releases.

#### scene
> **Type:** Boolean
**Example:** scene = true
**Description:** Some sites mark a release as scene or non-scene. Set it to true if you want only scene releases, false if you only want non-scene releases, or don't use this option if you don't care.

#### origins
> **Type:** Comma separated list
**Example:** origins = P2P, Internal
**Description:** Some trackers set the origin of a release in a more fine-grained manner than scene/non-scene.

#### freeleech
> **Type:** Boolean
**Example:** freeleech = true
**Description:** Only supported on a few trackers. Set to true if you only want to download freeleech releases. Set to false if you only want non-freeleech releases. Don't set if you don't care.

#### freeleech-percents
> **Type:** Number list
**Example:** freeleech-percents = 50,75
**Description:** Some trackers have multiple levels of freeleech. Set a Number list representing the percentages (without the % sign) of the releases you want to download.


## TV/Movies

#### shows
> **Type:** Comma separated list
**Example:** shows = The Simpsons, American Dad
**Description:** This is for TV-shows and movies. autodl-irssi will automatically extract the TV-show/movie name from a scene release name. Example, The.Simpsons.S35E24.720p.HDTV-BLAH will match a **shows** option set to **the simpsons**. You don't need wildcards at all, though it's possible to use wildcards. It's recommended to use **shows** instead of **match-releases** if all you want is for the filter to match TV-shows or movies.

#### smart-episode
> **Type:** Boolean
**Default:** false

**Description:** Set to true to prevent downloading earlier episodes than your latest download. This option is set per filter, not per show, so it only makes sense to set one show per filter.

#### resolutions
> **Type:** Comma separated list
**Example:** resolutions = SD, 720p, 1080p
**Description:** This is for TV-shows and movies only. Unless the release matches one of the resolutions, it's not downloaded. Valid resolutions are one or more of the following: **SD**, **480i**, **480p**, **576p**, **720p**, **810p**, **1080i**, **1080p**.
